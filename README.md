# VizualizeWithPython


In this project, I set out to explore the concept of randomness by generating a dataset of random numbers and visualizing them in various formats. The goal was to not only demonstrate the distribution and patterns (or lack thereof) that arise from random data but also to gain insights into how data visualization can enhance our understanding of randomness.
